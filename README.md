# Full Stack Project
A volunteer project as a part of the subject IDATT2105

## Initial clone
To get this project up and running there are 2 methods we show incase 1 does not work:<br>
### Cloning with git:
For this Git is goind to be required if you don't have Git you can download it [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).To clone with git you can use either the SSH link or HTTPS link you will find these under the code dropdown of the repository:<br>
![Clone links](./readmeImages/cloneLinks.png)
<br>

Then open a terminal and navigate to the location you want to clone the project(1) or go to that location and type cmd into the navigation in File Explorer(2)

Remember if you are confused about where you currently are you can type "dir" to get your directory and everything in it. Navigate with "cd" as you see above
<br>
<br>
2:<br>
![Navigate FileExplorer](./readmeImages/navigateFileExplorer.png)<br>
![Navigate FileExplorer](./readmeImages/typeCMD.png)<br>
As you can see here you navigate like normal in File Explorer then type cmd at the desired locaion.
<br>
<br>

After this use the command git clone (repo-URL)<br>
![Git Clone](./readmeImages/gitClone.png)<br>
If you get a printout like that you have successfully cloned the project

## Backend Setup
To setup the backend of the project, navigate into the project folder(full-stack-project) -> Backend -> ECOMBack. This is the Spring boot Java project that communicates with the database. Open this folder in an IDE, we recoment using IntelliJ IDEA.
<br><br>
The IDE shoul automatically import all necessary Maven dependencies, based on the pom.xml file. Alternatively, you can use the Maven command line to download and install the dependencies:
 ```
 mvn clean install
 ```

In the application-central.properties class, you can specify which database to use with the project (url, username and password). To get access to the centralized IDI MySQL database, please reach me at karo.f.mahmoud@gmail.com

![application-central.properties](./readmeImages/applicationPropertiesCentral.png)
<br><br>

To start the backend application, navigate to src/main/java/no/ntnu/ecomback/EcomBackApplication.java and run the main method in the IDE:<br>
![npm install](./readmeImages/runBackend.png)<br>

You can alternatively run the command 
 ``` 
 mvn spring-boot:run
 ```
 in the root of the backend project.
<br><br>



## Frontend Setup
To setup frontend navigate into project folder(full-stack-project) -> Frontend -> ecom. That is the frontend vue project. Open that folder in whatever IDE you want to open it in. We recoment VS Code for this.
<br><br>
After opening the project you need to install the node modules. There is no need to install them one by one ad they are listed in package.json. To install them you need to run:
 ```
 npm install
 ```
in the terminal at location. You can open a terminal in the ecom folder as you did in previous steps or you can open it in the IDE you are working in. In VS Code you can open a terminal bu clicking terminal then new terminal:<br>
![npm install](./readmeImages/npmInstall.png)<br>
If all goes well you will have installed all the dependencies you need. After this you are ready to run frontend with the command:
```
npm run dev
```
If you do i correctly it looks like this:<br>
![npm run dev](./readmeImages/npmRunDev.png)<br>
Opening the Local: link gives you the website. In this case typing http://localhost:5173 into your browser gives you this:<br>
![website](./readmeImages/websiteView.png)<br>
Remember that to get the Items Backend needs to be running
